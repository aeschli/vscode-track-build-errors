# VSCode Build Log Tracker

When working on the VSCode source code, many of us run `yarn watch` in an external terminal.

This extension tracks the build log generated by `yarn watch` (located at `.build/log`) and brings in the errors into the problems view.

See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#build for more information on how to build VSCode.


## Usage

- Run `yarn watch` in the vscode folder
- Open VSCode on that folder, Install the extension && check the problems view
- The extension activates if the workspace folders contains a file `.build/log`.
- The extension does not show problems in currently open documents.


**Enjoy!**
